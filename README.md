# ssh-scp-deploy

## ‚ùî Why should I use this action?

Because this action provide an easy and highly customizable way to upload files via scp and execute a set of command via ssh before or/and after.  
I use this action to deploy my personal projects to remote server, restarting the needed services or to do a simple upload via scp.
